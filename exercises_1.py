# Python exercises
# This series of exercises have been taken from `46 Python Exercises`
#
# 46 Python exercises is a collection of simple python exercises constructed
# (but in many cases only found and collected) by Torbj√∂rn Lager (torbjorn.lager@ling.gu.se).
#
# Most of them involve characters, words, and phrases, rather than numbers, and are therefore suitable
# for students interested in language rather than math.
#
# The original collection can be found at the following URL
# http://www.ling.gu.se/~lager/python_exercises.html

# The collection is divided in 4 sections:
#
# 1. Very Simple Exercises
# 2. Higher Order Functions And List Comprehensions
# 3. Simple exercises including I/O
# 4. Somehow harder exercises

# The idea of this project is to collect solutions for these exercises which
# may serve as reference for people getting started with python, as well as developers
# that want to take a look at different design solutions.
